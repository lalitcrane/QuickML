#### GPU Device Cost and Cloud Costs.

    1. NVidia Jetson Nano - Rs. 12,000 (4GB) (128 cores)
    2. NVidia NX - Rs. 30,000  (324 core)
    3. NVidia Jetson Nano - Rs. 7,000 (2GB) (128 cores)
    4. Short Run:  The Cloud GPU Costs are very very low compared GPU.
    5. Development Efforts: you should have a local hardware. Even  Nvidia 2GB can save lot of money.
    6. Long Run: Owning GPU can be worth.
    
    
##### Jetson Nano or Jetson NX Xavier vs Intel Movidius Neural 2 Stick

   1. For learning Machine Learning Use Jetson Nano.
   2  But for Realworld Product - Use Jetson NX
   3. Use GPU for training.
   4. But use CPU solution such as Intel Neural Stick 2 for inferencing.
   
 #### GPU vs CPU.
 
   1. Use GPU for Training. 
   2. Use CPU for inferencing, e.g. Intel Neural 2 Stick.
   
#### Jetxon NX ad Development Board
    As an Arm development environment, the Jetson Nano is excellent. 
    You get access to all the standard programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, Go, and Rust. 
    Plus there are all the Nvidia libraries and SDKs, like CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT. You can even install IDEs like Microsoft Visual Code!

    As I mentioned earlier, I was able to grab the software for the Doom 3 engine and build the game quite easily. 
    Plus I was able to try different machine learning tools like PyTorch and Numba. 
    When you factor in the support for a 4K display, 8GB of RAM, and the access to NVMe storage, the Xavier NX development board is a joy to use.


#### Using Graphic Cards for acceleration.

    * Linode offers such an option. 
    * The PlaidML offers such solution which is used by Linode.
    * Cards can improve performance to a certain extent.
    * But PlaidML ecosystem is entirely different and can be headache for developer.
    
    
####  How to buy CPU and GPU combo

    * New Generation CPUs are very costly. e.g i3, i5 9th Generation onwards, AMD 3**** Series for both Rayzen 3 and Rayzen 5
    * The AMD 25** series with a new generation GPU boards (e.g. Jetson) are goood combination.
    
#### Jetson GPU boards as PC

   * Other than softwared required for development efforts, there are no guarantees about availability of daily softwares.
   * Microsoft Office, Teams may not be available.
