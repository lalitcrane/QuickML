   1. For learning Machine Learning Use Jetson Nano.
   2  But for Realworld Product - Use Jetson NX
   
   
#### Jetxon NX ad Development Board
    As an Arm development environment, the Jetson Nano is excellent. 
    You get access to all the standard programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, Go, and Rust. 
    Plus there are all the Nvidia libraries and SDKs, like CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT. You can even install IDEs like Microsoft Visual Code!

    As I mentioned earlier, I was able to grab the software for the Doom 3 engine and build the game quite easily. 
    Plus I was able to try different machine learning tools like PyTorch and Numba. 
    When you factor in the support for a 4K display, 8GB of RAM, and the access to NVMe storage, the Xavier NX development board is a joy to use.
